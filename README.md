# Medieval-Game-

One of my first projects after learning the basics of C# and object oriented programming.

The basic idea behind the game is you select a character type, then challenge various enemies to combat in an arena, gaining gold and experience as you fight battles.  

Currently there are 4 races but only 2 have functionality (which I have used to test out various parts of the game as I build it out).

I plan to add more classes, skills, and a more dynamic combat sequence in the future.
